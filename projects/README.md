## Introuction
	Today you don't have to worry too much about the method of concealing a message ...
	Goner are the days when you had to ponder over the great selection of invisible inks
	to hide your secret affairs. You no longer have to worry about the safety of your
	servant when shaving its head with razorblades in order to write a message on his scalp,
	so that no one will bother to check once the hair grows back.

	So how would I do it today... I want to get my thoughts across without anyone
	getting the better of me? - you may impaciently ask. As for most questions in life,
	computers is the  answer. More specifically, encoding a digital message into
	another digital file using a bit of ingenuity, tricks and algorithms. Getting the message
	out will be as simple as reversing the process of hiding it, making it simple, safe and
	reliable for the recipient. Thus, we gather a lot of advantages from digital encoding:
		- Very hard to decode if one doesn't know the method of hiding.
		- Reliable, as the encoded file is persistent and doesn't change with time.
		- No limitations. It's entirely possible that the message may very well be an image, a
		document, or anything other than plain text.
		- It profundely reduces noticeble alterations to the original image, in contrast
		to physical steganography where the paper encoded presents visible damage or irregularities.
	
	Clearly, there's an overwhelimg superiority of digital steganography over traditional means.
	With so many advanatges backing it up, it's only logical that people will want to use it.
	There's allready a handful of tools out there capable of superbly hiding anything into images,
	implementing all of the advantages mentioned above (Some of the tools are: 'steghide', 'jsteg'
	or 'Hide'N'Steg').

	Alright, now you're interested in the subtle arts of hiding things in plain sight and want to
	learn more about it... How do you use it? What are the possibilites and what are the downsides?
	And how is such a seamingly complex process achieved? I will begin
